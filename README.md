# Product checkout

- Checkout class - ./utils/checkout.ts
- Checkout class test - ./utils/checkout.spec.ts
- Sample data - ./utils/sample-data.ts
- Interfaces - ./interfaces/index.ts
- Next.js boilerplate

I would addd tests to the react files, but i'm not sure this was part of the test.

## Scripts

> The main entities, the standard next.js scripts exist as well

- yarn dev
- yarn test
